If your dream job is a balance between UX design and technical-know-how, then this list of **UX Engineering jobs** is perfect for you. In this article we'll look at UX Engineer positions offered by the tech industry's **Big 5 companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google)**.

\[block id="uxe-jobs-banner"\]

Each of these companies offer positions that bridge the gap between design and development. _**Disclaimer:** Given the nature of this article (and the fast-paced tech industry in general), some of the positions listed may be filled by the time you read this. Search the company's career page for 'UX Engineer' to find similar positions._

## **Why the Big 5 Tech Companies?**

The **Big 5** are not the only companies to offer UX Engineer positions. They're not necessarily the top 5 tech companies on the Fortune 500 list either (IBM and HP are both ahead of Facebook). However, the Big 5 are often regarded as "the best places to work" by many in the tech industry.

## **UX Engineering at Amazon**

Among the big 5 tech companies, Amazon has the lowest Glassdoor rating (though, not by much) of 3.8 stars out of 5. In the past, Amazon suffered complaints against their harsh work-life balance and demanding culture. Today, however, [many employees are reporting that Amazon has improved](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036.htm) their focus on employee satisfaction.

[![Amazon's full logo](images/amazon-full.png)](https://uxengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/amazon-full.png)

Technically, Amazon does not have a position called "UX Engineer." However, considering most UX Designer positions do not require programming skills, Amazon's **Sr. UX Designer - EC2** position could probably be more appropriately described as a UX Engineer position.

**\[scroll\_to link="#microsoft-jobs" title="****UX Engineering at Microsoft****"\]**

## **UX Engineering at Microsoft**

Before there was a Big 5, there was a Big 4 and Microsoft wasn't on that list (depending on which list you looked at). Between the web browser that everyone loves to hate (Internet Explorer) and the not-so-successful Windows Phone ([and several other flops](https://www.neowin.net/news/the-top-10-microsoft-news-stories-of-2013)), Microsoft seemed to be past their prime. However, under current CEO, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's market cap has [more than doubled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/01/10/the-tech-industry-ceo-of-the-year-microsofts-satya-nadella/#58c4fd4b6c62) in the last 4 years.

## **UX Engineering at Apple**

Apple is believed to be the biggest reason UX Design exploded over the last decade. After the release of the first iPhone, other companies, large and small, responded in a hurry to hire UX professionals.

With a 4.5 out of 5 star rating from employees, Facebook currently sits at [#1 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work](https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm).

## **UX Engineering at Google**

In 2015 Google had the #1 spot on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work list. Today the company sits at #5, but if you exclude the non-tech companies from the list, then Google is the #2 best place to work, behind Facebook.

[![Google's full logos](images/google-full.png)](https://uxengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/google-full.png)

Out of the big 5 tech companies, Google was the first to offer a UX Engineer position...I think (need to verify that).

Google has multiple positions around UX Engineering. Traditionally, the role was split between **UX Engineer, Design** and **UX Engineer, Front End.** However, others have popped up more recently, specifically for Data Visualization, Android, AR/VR, Nest, and Project Soli.
