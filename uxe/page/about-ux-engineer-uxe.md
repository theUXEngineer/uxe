# About UX Engineer

The world’s most incredible, life-changing inventions have spawned from the intersection of art and science. Throughout history, we’ve encountered great minds, such as Socrates, Isaac Newton, and Leonardo DaVinci who’ve challenged the status quo and elevated humanity with their deep, multi-disciplinary knowledge. These individuals were ahead of their time. They were the rock stars of their day.

In today’s ever-changing, technology-driven world, rock stars are a little different. You may not know their names, but you’ve certainly been influenced by their work. Their reach and impact have permeated throughout the lives of billions of people.

Today’s rock stars are UX Engineers.

## About the Author

[![Nick Rollins](images/nick-rollins-300x300.png)](https://uxengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nick-rollins-300x300.png)Hi, my name is Nick Rollins. About 8 years ago I decided to learn how to build websites. The internet has changed a lot since then.

> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know

This blog provides an outlet for me to share things that I learn on my own journey.

Growing up, I had a knack for art and design, but no interest in math and science. However, somewhere along the way I shifted gears and found myself attending a college for engineers. The experience taught me that some people are gifted designers, some are gifted engineers, but very few are gifted at both. My goal was to be good at both.

In between classes, I built websites for small, local companies. I studied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and began learning how to approach design more objectively. I also had the opportunity to work at and manage a usability lab for 3 years while I was in college. In the lab, I learned how to conduct eye-tracking experiments and usability tests. Overall, my college experience was great and I learned a ton about UX Research.

## My Work

After graduating I had two job offers on the table. One was a UX Designer position for a banking company. The other was a Web Designer position for an eCommerce company. I worked hard to land that UX Designer position, but when it came down to it, I chose the Web Designer position because it provided an opportunity to grow as a designer AND a front-end developer.

I've been there for over two years now and I love it. My responsibilities span from the inception of an idea, to the validation, to the design and development of new website features. I spend about

- 25% of my time researching
- 25% of my time designing
- 50% of my time writing code

I look forward to going to work every day. It's intrinsically rewarding. One of my biggest motivations for starting this blog is to help others learn the skills they need to land their dream job too.

Every day is an opportunity to learn something new. If you are interested in following along, subscribe for weekly updates!
